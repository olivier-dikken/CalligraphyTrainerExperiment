## Research information

### Supporting expert-students deliberate practice

We are looking into how a tablet + stylus pen and custom software can support an expert with teaching a student, respecting the conditions of deliberate practice. 

Deliberate practice is a type of practice in which the student is closely guided by the teacher who is required to be an expert. The Calligraphy Trainer software was built to support the expert during deliberate practice by automating repetitive tasks. We will look into how the Calligraphy Trainer can help with automating aspects of the expert's guidance, allowing a student to do deliberate practice without an expert attentively present the entire time.

### Experiment details

You will participate in a classroom session with other students and a physical teacher, or individual session guided by the custom software. 
We will be asking you to practice predetermined calligraphy exercises with a digital tablet and pen for 3
distinct 15 minute sessions, and conduct a short pre-test before the first and post-test after the last session.

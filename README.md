## Research information

### Supporting expert facilitated deliberate practice of handwriting practice.

We are looking into how a sensor-based technology can support an expert facilitate deliberate practice of handwriting. If you are not a native Chinese person and have never attempted to learn to write or read Chinese, please consider becoming a participant in our study.

Deliberate practice is a type of conscious practice in which the student is closely guided by an expert teacher. As a participant you will either, practice writing Chinese characters with a teacher or practice with our custom application. We intend to evaluate the applicationâ€™s potential in supporting deliberate practice and not your ability to learn Chinese characters.

Your support is highly appreciated, and you will be compensated for your time (10 euro bol.com voucher/hr).

### Experiment Session details

We will be asking you to practice predetermined calligraphy exercises with a digital tablet and pen for 3
distinct 15 minute sessions, and conduct a short pre-test before the first and post-test after the last session.
